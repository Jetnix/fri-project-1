              <h3>Small beginnings...</h3>
              <p>I have little to no coding experience but I have always had an interest in it and didn't know where to begin, but now with Epicodus I finally feel like I'm getting somewhere and am finding a direction and could develope a future in coding. </p>
              <p>I currently work at Taco bell and have for almost 2 years. I actually really enjoy working there even thoough I hate the food!</p>
              <p>As a kid I always wanted to know how everythings works and I knew things were never as simple as they appear and I knew coding would be just the same. I have realistic expectations so for now it is just the beginning.</p>

              <h2>...a little about me<a href="img/erik.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="img/erik.jpg"></a></h2>
              <p>Hello my name is Chase, I'm currently 21 years old and I have a 5 month old son named Erik.</p>

              <p>Music is my passion and a big part of my life. My interest in music just developed recently. I'm slowly learning how to play guitar on my free time and I look forward to it every single day. I make time for it even at the sacrifice of sleep at times. I also have experience in the past with competitive gaming when I was in high school but decided to focus on school/life in the end.</p>

              <p><a href="img/spencer.jpg" target="_about"><img src="img/spencer.jpg"></a>I am also interested in exotic animals. Currently I only own a tarantula smaller than a dime, so for now I'm mostly living this passion through some of my best friends. I am a huge fan of <em><strong>Studio Ghibli</strong></em> films, my faovrites being Princess Mononoke and of course Spirited Away. I also am obsessed with a little show called <strong><em>Rick and Morty</strong></em> to the point that the show itself has influenced my look on life and the world around me and has inspired me to do some digging of my own. I find it amazing how a simple teleivision show that is also a comedy can make a person think about life so much. I am very interested in psychology and am constantly thinking about how experiences will affect a person and how people react to certain stimuli. Considered majoring in psychology and pursuing a career as a psychologist or a counsellor but I have always had an interest and coding so now here I am.</p>

              <p>Something I've learned about myself is that I can be a slow learner and will typically be behind most people with the same amount of experience, but when I finally grasp the concept I will begin to pick up things very quickly and can do things I would've never imagined I would be able to do in the beginning.</p>

              <p>I'm still a child at heart and have a lot to learn but I'm growing stronger every day.</p>
